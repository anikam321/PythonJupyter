# Carbon Dioxide Levels

        Measuring carbon dioxide levels in classrooms serves a  great purpose when analyzing the brain functionality of a student. 
    Having the privilege to shadow the research of Professor Baglione and senior Kevin Dai regarding the carbon dioxide levels of 
    particular rooms in 41 Cooper Square has given me the opportunity  to  analyze the data collected. Using a Onset HOBO MX1102 
    Bluetooth Carbon Dioxide Data Logger, the data graphed in my final python project illustrates the trend in carbon dioxide levels 
    in Room 106. This data collected over a week long period documents the dips and spikes of levels of carbon dioxide. These trends 
    show when the classroom was filled withs students in comparison to when it was empty.
